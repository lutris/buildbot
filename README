Lutris buildbot
===============

This repository contains various build scripts for runners and games used by
Lutris. The target system for these scripts is Ubuntu 16.04 (the same system
used by the Lutris runtime).

It is advised to run these scripts from a LXC container. It's potentially
possible to use other container technology such as Docker but we strongly
advise against it. Virtual machines are ok to use too.

The only case where these containers need to communicate is when build 64bit
builds of Wine. These builds are actually multi-arch and provide 32 and 64bit
support. Make sure the 32 bit container is able to SSH (without a password) to
ubuntu@buildbot64 and inversely, that the 64bit container can SSH to
ubuntu@buildbot32.

To create the containers, first make sure you have the client installed::

    sudo apt install lxd lxd-client

Also make sure to add your current user to the lxc group::

    sudo usermod -G lxd myusername
    newgrp lxd

You can create the containers with a command such as::

    lxc launch images:ubuntu/bionic/amd64 buildbot-bionic-amd64

or for the 32bit container::

    lxc launch images:ubuntu/bionic/i386 buildbot-bionic-i386

To set up the container, you can enter it with the following command::

    lxc exec <container name> bash

The minimal system should have the following packages installed::

    apt-get install -y build-essential vim git wget curl python openssh-server

Set a passwd for your ubuntu user::

    passwd ubuntu

Get the IP of the container with `lxc list`::

Set up entries in your ~/.ssh/config::

    Host buildbot-bionic-amd64
        Hostname 10.214.185.55
        User ubuntu

    Host buildbot-bionic-i386
        Hostname 10.214.185.101
        User ubuntu

Connect to the container::

    ssh buildbot-bionic-i386

Generate ssh keys for both containers::

    mkdir -p ssh/buildbot{32,64}
    cd ssh/buildbot32
    ssh-keygen -f ./id_rsa
    cd ../buildbot64
    ssh-keygen -f ./id_rsa

Run the container setup script::

    ./setup-container buildbot-bionic-amd64

On both containers, run the necessary ssh-copy-id commands and make sure that
the 64bit container is able to ssh to the 32bit one with `ssh buildbot32` and
the other way around with `ssh buildbot64`.

To install packages without having to enter a root password add with visudo:

    ubuntu   ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get

If you plan to publish runners and runtimes to Digital Ocean, don't forget to
copy the configuration files in ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.s3cfg
