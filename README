Lutris buildbot
===============

This repository contains various build scripts for runners and games used by
Lutris. The target system for these scripts is Ubuntu 14.04 (the same system
used by the Lutris runtime).

It is advised to run these scripts from a LXC container. You can create one
with the following command::

    sudo lxc-create -t ubuntu -n buildbot64 -- -r trusty

or for the 32bit container::

    sudo lxc-create -t ubuntu -n buildbot32 -- -r trusty --arch i386

The minimal system should have the following packages installed::

    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential vim git wget curl python

To build with Docker, use:

   docker build -t buildbot .
   docker run -v $(pwd):/buildbot buildbot games/supertux

To install packages without having to enter a root password add with visudo:

    ubuntu   ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get
