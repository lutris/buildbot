Subject: [PATCH] winegstreamer: adjust GetSlowestRate and GetFastestRate
 values

Per the docs, 0 would not render additional frames:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/medfound/about-rate-control
A rate of zero causes one frame to be rendered; after that, the presentation
clock does not advance. To get another frame at the rate of zero, the
application must seek to a new position.

Having this set to 0 causes Godfall's new character intro video to
black screen, seemingly because it only renders one frame.

Based on the current GetFastestRate value attempt, if we approach the logic on
numerical positive/negative values, the fastest forward rate would be
1e6f (1000000f) and slowest 1.0f, while in reverse the fastest would
be -1.0f and slowest -1e6f (-1000000f).

This fixes Godfall's new character intro video playback and does not
appear to break other tested games.
